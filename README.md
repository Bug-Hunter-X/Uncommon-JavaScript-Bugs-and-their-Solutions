# Uncommon JavaScript Bugs

This repository contains examples of uncommon bugs that can occur in JavaScript and their solutions. The focus is on issues that may not be immediately obvious to developers with intermediate JavaScript experience.

## Bugs Covered

*   **Incorrect use of `this` keyword:**  Explores scenarios where the `this` keyword doesn't behave as expected and how to properly use `bind()` for explicit binding.
*   **Implicit type coercion:** Demonstrates problems arising from JavaScript's automatic type conversion, especially in arithmetic operations.
*   **Forgetting to handle edge cases:** Shows the importance of handling empty arrays or other boundary conditions to prevent unexpected behavior.
*   **Problems with closures:** Explains potential issues and illustrates the correct use of closures.

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open `bug.js` to see the buggy code and `bugSolution.js` to see the fixes.
3.  Use a JavaScript environment (like Node.js or a browser's developer console) to run the code.
